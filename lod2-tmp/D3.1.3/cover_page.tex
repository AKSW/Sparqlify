\textbf{Abstract:} Triplify is a lightweight tool for converting relational databases to RDF. % via a configuration based on SQL queries. 
In LOD2, we have significantly enhanced its functionality and -- since it covers slightly different use cases -- released it as a separate tool dubbed \emph{Sparqlify}.
Sparqlify is based on using CONSTRUCT queries to define views on a relational database in such a way that SPARQL queries on those views can be efficiently translated to SQL queries.
In addition, Sparqlify allows to create full RDF dumps from a relational database and expose provenance information.
This deliverable consists of a user's guide,
which gives extensive examples on how to use the tool,
and technical documentation that details the query rewriting approach formally and implementation wise.
