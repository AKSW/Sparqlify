    comment = {Good background overview in section 2, and related work in section 6. 

There are 2 types of database-to-ontology mappings: 
1. creating ontology from db, i.e. simply mapping the tables to classes, the rows to subject, the columns to predicates and the cells to objects.
2. mapping a db to an existing ontology; requires more complex mapping.

A system is proposed that combines different heterogenic datasources and provides a query Webservice to perform semantic queries as if it were one source. To achieve this, is proposes to use a central domain-model ontology. A query based on the central ontology is analyzed and distributed over the various datasources, as the central query-Webservice knows which data is available where. The different datasources have two mappings. One is the mapping of their local data representation (e.g. relational db) to a local ontology. The second is the mapping from the local ontology to the central ontology. 

The only part detailed enough to be useful is the automatic mapping generation (generating from db) method used by DB2OWL. They say DB2OWL uses the R2O language to define the resulting mapping description. The mapping rules is explained in detail, but is actually stolen from Stojanovic et al., 2002, with the exception of a few detailes that weren't even possible for Stojanovic because it was written in the pre-OWL era. Although this work is referred as 'related work', shame on the authors for giving so little credit to Stojanovic! The good news is that they do a better job at explaining the method. 

The document does mention a similarity estimation process to estimate how good two ontologies match, but does not elaborate on this process nor the mapping of the local ontology to the central ontology - while this is the hard part! I should find a source that explains the rest, if that has been actually worked out.

Database content is mapped to RDF by a declar- ative mapping which specifies how resources are identified and how property values are generated from database content. Based on this mapping, D2R Server allows Web agents to retrieve RDF and XHTML representations of resources and to query non-RDF databases using the SPARQL query lan- guage over the SPARQL protocol. The gener- ated representations are richly interlinked on RDF and XHTML level in order to enable browsers and crawlers to navigate database content.},

  abstract = {The SPARQL query language for RDF provides Semantic Web developers with a powerful tool to extract information from large datasets. This report describes a transformation from SPARQL into the relational algebra, an abstract intermediate language for the expression and analysis of queries. This makes existing work on query planning and optimization available to SPARQL implementors. A further translation into SQL is outlined, and mismatches between SPARQL semantics and 
the relational approach are discussed.

@inproceedings{triplify,
  abstract = {In this paper we present Triplify - a simplistic but effective approach to publish Linked Data from relational databases. Triplify is based on mapping HTTP-URI requests onto relational database queries. Triplify transforms the resulting relations into RDF statements and publishes the data on the Web in various RDF serializations, in particular as Linked Data. The rationale for developing Triplify is that the largest part of information on the Web is already stored in structured form, often as data contained in relational databases, but usually published by Web applications only as HTML mixing structure, layout and content. In order to reveal the pure structured information behind the current Web, we have implemented Triplify as a light-weight software component, which can be easily integrated into and deployed by the numerous, widely installed Web applications. Our approach includes a method for publishing update logs to enable incremental crawling of linked data sources. Triplify is complemented by a library of con?gurations for common relational schemata and a REST-enabled data source registry. Triplify con?gurations containing mappings are provided for many popular Web applications, including osCommerce, WordPress, Drupal, Gallery, and phpBB. We will show that despite its light-weight architecture Triplify is usable to publish very large datasets, such as 160GB of geo data from the OpenStreetMap project. },
