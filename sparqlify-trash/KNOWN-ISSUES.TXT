- [Rewrite] Combining Distinct + Order By does not yield correct ordering.
   The reason is that in the SQL the Order By becomes a sub-query of the query doing the distinct.
   Distinct does not preserve the order.
   
- [Config] Prefixes and strings are not correctly found out to be equal:
  Given Prefix ns:<http://ex.org/> and the var-defs
      ?x = spy:uri(ns:foo)
      ?y = spy:uri(http://ex.org/foo)
  the system will not realize that the vars can be joined.


- In the 'with' part: The same variable definition may appear multiple times, in which case previous one are overwritten
  Throw an exception if that happens.
   system.addView(RdfView.create("{ ?v3s geo:religion ?v3r. } with ?v3s = beef:uri(concat('http://entitiy/', ?id)) ; ?v3s = beef:uri(concat('http://rel/', ?rname)); select id, rname from religions"));
